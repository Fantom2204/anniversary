        <p>Just can't believe that a year has passed by........ I still can't believe how I got you. You are the best thing that happened to me. I'm very happy that I got up that morning and came to that date even though I was hungover. The night
          before I wished that we wouldn't go on that pancake date as friends. I vividly remember texting you at 4 in the morning and telling you that be ready by 8. I knew you were having a very hard time with your break-up and that is the main
          reason why I accepted to take you out. Niraj was also going to stay at my place but he couldn’t and that is why it was just the two of us. I still remember you walking out of your gate and I just couldn’t believe what I saw. For a moment I
          thought that I was still hungover. That search for pancakes with you behind me, that coffee at CCD, and then dropping you back home, this all was enough for me to fall for you. I still think what if I wouldn’t have told you that afternoon?
          Thinking of that situation just gives me goose bumps. I just had a huge smile on my face all the way back home. All the moments spent with you have made me the person I am today. I was just so good at reading you from the start right? I
          knew you were going to say yes the moment I confessed to you. That smile made it clear for me. I still don’t know how I gathered so much courage to ask you out. You were my first at everything. You are my first love, my first relationship,
          my first kiss and I want you to be my last too. If I sit and even try to explain the moments I’ve had with you I might need to create more websites than there already are on the internet.</p>

        <p>You were there with me every moment of my life till date. It doesn’t matter whether we fight or laugh you always take care of me. I know that things haven’t been perfect all the time but I just love all the time I spent with you. From
          fighting to scolding you, from putting you to bed to going on morning walks with you, I love every moment spent with you. There are some things that I will never forget throughout my life, things like you making food for me or waking me up
          or protecting me or troubling me or teaching me……….. There are millions of things that I can go on listing. I’m very proud of you for who you are and I respect you a lot. I feel like asking about every single thing before doing it. I want
          to make every single decision after discussing with you. I say that you’re not mature and stuff like that, but to tell you the truth, you are mature in your own way. You’ve taught me millions of things which I think I would’ve never tried
          to learn. I will never forget you teaching me to code with so much patience even when I kept shouting at you millions of times. I just love the way you make me understand things. I’m the luckiest guy to have ended up with you. I love you
          with all my heart and I wish that we celebrate this day with the same joy and love for millions of years to come. </p>
